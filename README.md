Kon'nichiwa!

Sometime in spring of 2025, an update to `@hono/node-server` broke my hacked-together full-stack app implmentation for PrairieWx, so I needed to find a way to bring the app into the new way of doing things.

I am iterating on this to ensure I can add all of the features and functionality that I need in order to build and deploy full-stack apps on top of the backend that I love so much: Hono.

I'm using `hono`, `@hono/node-server`, and `@hono/vite-dev-server` along with `vite` for this implementation.
